# Supernovae_light-curves
According to theoretical models, After an event of supernova, the light curve rises rapidly and later decreases slowly. I calculated such light curvesand compared them to measured data, in order to obtain a set of parameters for each supernove.
This repository doesn't contain the code that represents the model, since it was written by those who developed the model.
